Hi I'm **Eoin Coffey**, a Software Engineer from beautiful Colorado.

I love writing code in Compositional and Functional styles, and my passion in software is finding better ways to express the Intent of software over the Mechanics of implementation. That and Big-O and Graph Theory jokes.

See [Philosophy]({{ "/philosophy.html" | relative_url }}) for more details about how I like to work.
